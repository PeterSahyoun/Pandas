# Pandas
Python For Data Analysis

Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data.

In 'pandas_lab.py' I have presented the following:
-How to make data frames using pandas library.
-Operations that you can perform on pandas dataframe (Slicing, Merging, Joining, Concatination, Changing the index and the column headers).
-Data Munging: means that you can actually convert a particular format of data into a different format.
-Aggregation
-Querying
